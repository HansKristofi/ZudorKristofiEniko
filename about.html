                <p>
                    Enikő is a contemporary Hungarian painter and graphic artist whose work is an intimate
                    conversation between memory and place — rooted in the light, architecture, and seasons
                    of her beloved Oradea (Nagyvárad).
                </p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in 1960, Enikő grew up in a household saturated with art. Her primary mentor was her
                    father, János Kristófi (1925–2014), a celebrated painter who shaped the cultural identity
                    of Oradea for over five decades. That inheritance is visible in every canvas she makes —
                    a romantic attention to detail, a documentary instinct — yet her voice is entirely her own.
                </p>

                <h2>Style &amp; Themes</h2>
                <p>
                    Her work moves fluidly between the monumental and the lyrical. She is best known for her
                    <em>cityscapes of Oradea</em> — architectural studies that capture the city's layered
                    history in soft, precisely observed light. Alongside these urban works are gentle
                    depictions of parks and promenades: <em>Parc toamna</em> (Autumn Park),
                    <em>Sétány</em> (Promenade) — paintings where seasonal colour becomes a quiet emotional language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sacred spaces and interior scenes recur throughout her career, rendered in tempera and
                    gouache on cardboard or canvas. Her background as a graphic artist gives her work a
                    distinctive precision — clean edges, controlled composition — that sets her apart from
                    the looser romanticism of her father's generation.
                </p>

                <h2>Exhibitions &amp; Collections</h2>
                <p>
                    Enikő has exhibited widely across Central Europe, often in family shows alongside
                    her father and sister Judith Kristófi.
